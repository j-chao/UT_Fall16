# Systematic treatment of equilibrium
        1. Write down all relevant reactions
        2. Charge balance
        3. Mass balance
        4. Write down relevant eq. expressions
        5. Should have N equations w/ N unknowns

### What is the charge balance eq of an aq solution containing H~3~PO~4~ and KOH?
        * \ce {KOH + H2O -> K* + OH}
        * H3PO4 + H2O <-> H3O+ H2PO4
        * H2O <-> H3O+ + OH-
        * H2PO4- <-> HPO4 2- + H+
        * HPO4 2- <-> PO4 2- + H+

        * [K*] + [H+] = [OH-] + [H2PO4-] + [H2PO4 2-] + [PO42-]
        * H3PO4 <-> PO4 3- + 3H+
        * therefore: [H+] = 3[PO4 3-]

## Mass Balance
        * What's the mass balance eq when 0.005 mols of H3PO4 is dissolved in 1L
          H2O?
        * 0.005 M = [H3PO4] + [H2Po4-] + [HPO4 2-] + [PO4 3-]
        * where [H3PO4]] is undissociated

## Example
        * What is mass balance eq when slightly soluble Ag3PO4 is in saturated
          solution in water?
        * Ag3PO4 <-> 3Ag+ + PO4 3-
        * [Ag+] = 3[PO4 3-], but Po4 also reacts with water...
        * [Ag+] = 3([PO4 3-] + [H3PO4] + [H2PO4-] + [HPO4 2-])

        * NH3 + H2O <-> NH4+ + OH- Kb
        * H2O <-> H+ + OH- Kw
        * [NH4+] + [H+] = [OH-] 
        * 0.010M = [NH3] + [NH4+] = formal concentration 
        * Kw = [H+][OH-] = 1.0e-14 @ 25C
        * Kb = [NH4+][OH-] / [NH3] = 1.76e-5
        * 4 equations for 4 unknowns ([NH3], [NH4], [OH], [H+])
        * (can ignore activity)
