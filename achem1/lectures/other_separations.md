# Molecular Exclusion
* size exclusion, separation based on size
* minimize affinity for absorptions between mobile/stationary phase
    - minimize all interactions other than size
* larger molecules elute first, since less interaction with mobile phase inside

### Retention Volume
* volume of mobile phase required to elute a particular solute from the column
* V~r~ = t~r~ * u
* larger K = larger V~r~

# Ion Exchange
* stationary phase is charged
    - electrostatically bound to a counterion
* charged analyte *quantitatively* displaces another charged species from
  stationary phase
* cation exchange 
    - postively charged stationary phase / negatively charged analyte 
    - cation is exchanged
* hydration of ions
