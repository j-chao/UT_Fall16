# Calibration Curves

* LOD (signal) = signal blank + 3s
* LOD (concentration) = (3s)/m , expressed in mmol
* LOQ (concentration) = (10s)/m

# Accounting for matrix
### Standard addition

* create calibration curve
* varying concentration of analyte, all with same volume
* matrix is contant across all samples while varying conc of unknown

    $[analyte] = [X]_f + [S]_f (f = dilution)$

* record signal intensity (ex: absorbance)

* for a linear relationship b/w conc and signal
* signal sample:

    I~x~ $\alpha$ [x]~i~  
    signal (sample + standard): I~x+s~ $\alpha$ [x]~f~ + [S]~f~    
$$
    \frac{[X]_i}{([S]_f + [X]_f)} = \frac{I_x}{I_{s+x}}
$$

### Plotting standard addition data

$$
y = \frac{I_x}{[X]_i} x + I_x 
$$ 

* we want to know [X]~i~, which is the x-intercept


### Addition of Internal Standards

Response Factor (F):

$$
\frac{Analyte Signal}{[Analyte]} = F * \frac{Standard Signal}{[Standard]}
$$ 

# Equilibrium
## Chapter 6

A + B = AB

$$ 
K = \frac{[AB]} {[A][B]}
$$ 

* K > 1 : reaction is favored
* K is unitless/dimensionless
* solids & pure liquids are not included in equilibrium constant
* all rxns are included relative to standard states
