# Electrophoresis
* electrophoretic mobility
* electroosmotic mobility
* apparent mobility

## ion migration time

## Van Deemter Equation
* only B is effected/measured

## Optimizing Separation
* increasing voltage = increased flow rate

# Electrochemistry

## Batteries
* anode = where oxidation ocurs
* cathode = where reduction occurs

### galvanic cell
* spontaneous charge flow  
    $\Delta G = -nFE$

## electrochemical cell
* calculating cell potential  
    E~{cell}~ = E~{cathode}~ - E~{anode}~

## Nernst equation


# Electrolysis


## overpotentials (non-spontaneous movement of charges)
* concentration polarization
* activation overpotential
* IR drop (ohmic potential)

* Ch. 13, 14, 16
