### source: https://data.humdata.org/dataset/data-for-ebola-recovery

Data on health, economic livelihoods, food security, and ebola vigilance from
representative survey of Monrovia conducted in December 2014, March 2015, and
June 2015. Full details, results and analysis can be found at
data4ebolarecovery.org

The December survey was conducted from December 6, 2014 to January 7, 2015 by
our implementing partner, Parley, a Liberian NGO. Enumerators conducted surveys
in person using handheld devices operating the Pendragon Survey Software.
Follow-up surveys in March and June were conducted by phone.

The selection of respondents followed a three-stage sampling procedure. In the
the first stage, 77 communities were randomly selected from all of Monroviaâ€™s
fifteen administrative wards in proportion to their population size. In the
second stage, twenty households were randomly selected within each community
following a random-walk procedure. Within each household, a single adult
respondent was randomly selected for the survey. The response rate was 95%.

The survey covered outreach efforts, attitudes toward survivors, knowledge of
Ebola symptoms and transmission paths, uptake of Ebola prevention practices,
Ebola incidence histories, health outcomes, food security, economic outcomes,
and social outcomes. The survey lasted about 45 minutes on average.
